Supervisor
==========

Supervisor is a client/server system that allows its users to
control a number of processes on UNIX-like operating systems.

Supported Platforms
-------------------

Supervisor has been tested and is known to run on Linux (Ubuntu), Mac OS X
(10.4, 10.5, 10.6), and Solaris (10 for Intel) and FreeBSD 6.1.  It will
likely work fine on most UNIX systems.

Supervisor will not run at all under any version of Windows.

*This is the master branch, which will become Supervisor 4.0.  The main
change from Supervisor 3.x is added support for Python 3, which is still a
work-in-progress, and has not been released yet.  If Python 3 support is
important to you, we would appreciate if you would test this branch and
report any issues you encounter.  If you depend on Supervisor in production,
you should probably be running a release version of Supervisor 3.x.*

Supervisor 4.0 will work under Python 2 version 2.6 or greater and Python 3
version 3.2 or greater.
